    <h2>Automate manual tasks</h2>
    <p>With competition on the rise, customer acquisition is a struggle for hotels.

    Among other things, they need to capture the details of all their potential customers across multiple channels to get more leads.
    
    Updating these details manually using spreadsheets and other tools can lead to data fragmentation. 
    
    Freshsales, the hospitality CRM, automatically captures hotel booking inquiries from live chat, email, and web forms and makes it available in a single screen.</p>

<p>The hotel CRM also:</p>

<ul>
<li>Auto-enriches each prospect's details from their social profiles</li>
<li>Automatically assigns prospects to the right agent by resort location, preferences, etc., and alerts them via email</li>
<li>Tracks and captures the prospect's activities on your website</li>
<li>Uses scores based on buying signals to surface the best prospects to connect with</li>
