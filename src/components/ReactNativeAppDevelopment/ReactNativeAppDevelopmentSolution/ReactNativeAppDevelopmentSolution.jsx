                               <p> Prototype and wireframes development are two important steps in the design process. They help to ensure that everything from the user interface to the layout of a website or app is correct before any actual coding is done. Without proper prototypes and wireframes, it can be difficult to make changes later on without causing major headaches.</p>

                               <p> React Native is a mobile development platform that lets you build user interfaces (UIs) and user experiences (UXs) using JavaScript. Instead of developing each component separately, React Native allows you to create reusable components which can be plugged into your app's existing codebase. This makes it easier to develop and maintain your app, as well as improve its overall UX/UI. </p>

                               <p>React Native is a mobile development platform that makes it easy to build native apps using React. It uses the same JavaScript syntax and libraries as regular React apps, but it targets mobile devices and platforms instead of web browsers.</p>
