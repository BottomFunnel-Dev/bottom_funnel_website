                Defining the objectives provides a clear picture of the
                stakeholders's expectation from the UX Review. We highlight
                business objectives to steer the project in the right direction
                and witness tangible results.

                We study user journey and behavioural patterns to ascertain the
                reason behind user dropouts.

              <h3>Usability review</h3>
              <p>
                Usability is the core of a UX Review. We conduct usability
                testing to identify patterns that indicate a gap in the user's
                journey and gather invaluable insights.

              <h3>Feedback</h3>
              <p>
                After analyzing every micro-interaction, we provide our clients
                a detailed feedback as to where the product is lagging. We view
                the feedback as an opportunity, not a list of problems, setting
                the scope for improvement.
