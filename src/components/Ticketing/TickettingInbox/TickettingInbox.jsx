            <p>Unlike Email Our Ticketing system is designed for team collaboration and agent productivity.This means that you can do so much more than just sending replies.
                prioritize every ticket based on the keywords. Assign every ticket to a specific agent and group so there is no confusion about who should be working on which ticket.
